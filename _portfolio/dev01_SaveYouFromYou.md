The game was developed using **p5.js** and features a 2D space-themed strategy game. The protagonist must navigate through space to reach Earth. A custom physics engine was built to simulate gravity, bouncing, and collisions, ensuring realistic interactions. Special attention was given to maintaining smooth and responsive game mechanics for an engaging player experience.
